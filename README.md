# superstar-song-generator
Project is supposed to generate superstar songs using ChatGPT as a music producer and DALL-E as an album cover designer.

In fact it's just an educational app that presents usage of gRPC as a communication tool in microservices applications.


# How to start
Run script that will initialize the repository for you:

    $ bin/dev_init.sh

It will generate certificates, copy env file and build the docker image. For older versions of docker, please change `docker compose` for `docker-compose`.

# How to generate python files from .proto
Install [python package](https://pypi.org/project/grpcio-tools/) for grpc tools, and then use another script:

    $ bin/generate_protobuf_files.sh

# Basic information
## Interceptors

### Metrics
[Prometheus metrics](https://pypi.org/project/py-grpc-prometheus/)

[OpenTelemetry metrics](https://opentelemetry-python-contrib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/instrumentation/grpc/grpc.html#opentelemetry-grpc-instrumentation)

It looks like NewRelic has some support, as well.

### Logs
It looks like there is no library for that. However it can be easily implemented based on existing interceptors. Having basic interceptor we can choose whichever logging platform satisfying our needs.

### Authentication Interceptor
[SSL/TLS + Custom Header with token](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/auth/#with-server-authentication-ssltls-and-a-custom-header-with-token)


## Strategies
https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/core-concepts/#rpc-life-cycle

Generally all four strategies are available (unary, response-streaming, request-streaming, bidirectional streaming), **BUT** [Best Practices for Python](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/performance/#python) discourage developers to use streaming, as it creates more threads and makes it much slower than unary RPCs. Thank you GIL, once again :D

## Proto files
It is recommended to define widely used messages in [separate files](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/dos-donts/#do-define-widely-used-message-types-in-separate-files).

Python files that are generated by the protoc compiler have broken imports if we want to store them in some directory. It requires some changes. To fix that, `bin/generate_protobuf_files.sh` modifies all `*.py` files inside `song_generator` directory.
